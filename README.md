# dynnorm
Code used in the paper "Facilitating innovation diffusion in social networks using dynamic norms" by M. L. Zino, M. Ye, and M. Cao

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2021a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the folder. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the folder with MATLAB.

The code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.9 GHz with OS Windows 10 (64-bit). The run time of a simulation with n=100,000 individuals and T=50 time-steps is approximately 0.3 seconds.

ORGANIZATION:

CoTr(n,k,alpha,gamma,beta,T,pl) simulates the base model presented in the paper
CoTrG(A,k,alpha,gamma,beta,T,pl) simulates the generalized model presented in the SI

The repository contains also the scripts to generate all the figures in the paper. In particular, to generate Figure % (or the panel * of figure %) can be generated by running the file "Fig#.m" or "Fig%_a.m."
