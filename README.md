# dynnorm
Code used in the paper "Facilitating innovation diffusion in social networks using dynamic norms" by M. L. Zino, M. Ye, and M. Cao

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2021a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the folder. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the folder with MATLAB.

The code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.9 GHz with OS Windows 10 (64-bit). The run time of a simulation with n=100,000 individuals and T=50 time-steps is approximately 0.3 seconds.

ORGANIZATION:

CoTr(n,k,alpha,gamma,beta,T,pl) simulates the base model presented in the paper
CoTrG(A,k,alpha,gamma,beta,T,pl) simulates the generalized model presented in the SI
CoTR_h_trest(n,k,alpha,t0) estimates the threshold for the model with heterogeneous advantage
CoTr_fix(n,k,alpha,gamma,beta,T,pl) simulates the model in the scenario in which the individuals who follow each of the rule is determined at time t=0
CoTr_Kincrease(n,k,alpha,gamma,beta,T,K,pl) simulates the model in the scenario in which trends are perceived if and only if ther eis an increase/decrease of at least K individuals


The repository contains also the scripts to generate all the figures in the paper. In particular, to generate Figure % (or the panel * of figure %) can be generated by running the file "Fig#.m" or "Fig%_a.m."

The repository contains the folder "raw_data_for_figures" that contains the raw data (as .tex files) used for the figures in the paper.
